            "includes": "WMI V12, V11, V10, SC Model, Macrostiff",
            "vibe": "These are the cutting edge. 'WMI' likely stands for 'World Model Iteration.' These models use the latest End-to-End (E2E) architecture, meaning they 'see' the world more like a human. They understand 3D scenes, stop signs, intersections, and road edges - not just painted lines. WMI V12 is the current flagship. It's the smartest at complex urban scenarios but can feel slightly 'loose' on straight highways because it's constantly micro-adjusting like a human driver would. If you drive mostly city streets with stop signs and turns, this is your series.",
            "bestFor": "Daily driving in 2026. They balance smoothness with intelligence.",
            "recommendation": "Start with WMI V12. If it feels too 'wiggly' on highways, try Macrostiff for tighter steering feel."

            "vibe": "High-performance, high-attention. Dark Souls is named because it's 'unforgiving' or 'hardcore.' Expect tighter following distances, faster acceleration, and sharper turns. It drives like a human who is in a hurry but still safe. Great for heavy trucks (F-150s, Sierras) that need authoritative inputs to move their mass. The Firehose model is the raw developer feed - it changes almost daily. Some days it's brilliant, other days it has bugs. Only for adventurous testers who don't mind occasional weirdness.",
            "bestFor": "Heavy traffic commuters who don't want people cutting them off.",

            "vibe": "Relaxed and passenger-friendly. Down to Ride (DTR) is famous for being 'wife-approved.' It prioritizes gentle braking and slow turns over perfect lane centering. Kumars Vibe is custom-tuned for a specific car setup but became popular because it removes the 'robotic' feel - very natural steering transitions. These models are perfect for road trips where passengers might get motion sick from abrupt steering corrections.",
            "bestFor": "Road trips with family or passengers who get motion sick.",

            "vibe": "These are experimental training runs. Despite the name, some are hidden gems! Tomb Raider 16 (Trash Folder 16) was a community favorite for a long time due to its unique handling of highway curves. It felt like driving 'on rails.' These models often have quirks but can surprise you with excellent performance in specific scenarios. Worth trying if you drive curvy roads.",
            "bestFor": "Adventurous users looking for unique driving characteristics.",

            "vibe": "The 'Old Guard.' These models are from 2023-2024. They are less 'smart' (bad at stop signs) but incredible at highway lane keeping. Recertified Herbalist is the 'Gold Standard' of stability. North Dakota is famous for its STIFF steering - it hugs the center of the lane and refuses to move. WD40 'lubricated' this stiffness for smoother inputs. Blue Diamond excels in rain and poor lane markings. These are the 'Toyota Camry' of models - boring, reliable, and rock solid.",
            "bestFor": "Highway-focused driving with rock-solid lane centering.",
            "recommendation": "Recertified Herbalist for long road trips. North Dakota if you want maximum stiffness."
